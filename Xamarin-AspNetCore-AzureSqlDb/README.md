# Powering Xamarin with Azure SQL database using ASP.NET Core Web API

This repository contains the project code for the article that I wrote, with the similar title. Project contains the ASP.NET Web API written to take care of the data handling and management, at the backend. The data is stored and fetched from Azure SQL database and the final UI of the application is built with Xamarin for Android, as a mobile application.

The notable features include:

1. High performance with Azure SQL databases.
2. High response rate with Azure App Services. The API itself is built with ASP.NET Core but is hosted on Azure App Service to reach the maximum performance.
3. Xamarin was used to build the mobile application. 

You may download the code and try it out with your own stuff. To learn how the framework was built, or to learn more about the usage of this application you may read the article that I wrote about this application setup.
